# AutoInsight: Automated Data Analysis
Building AI course project

## Summary
AutoInsight is an AI-driven tool for automated CSV data analysis. It helps identify correlations and generates quick textual insights from datasets by automatically calculating means and identifying strong relationships between numeric variables. This project simplifies the initial data exploration phase for analysts.

## Background
Which problems does your idea solve? How common or frequent is this problem? What is your personal motivation? Why is this topic important or interesting?

* problem 1
* problem 2

## How is it used?
Describe the process of using the solution. In what kind situations is the solution needed? Who are the users, what kinds of needs should be taken into account?
